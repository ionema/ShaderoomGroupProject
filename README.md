## Overview

**Description**

A social media forum website that discusses news, gossip, and lifestyle for men and women ages 18 - 35.


**App Evaluation**
- **Category:** Social Networking / Music
- **Story:** Delivers news, gossip, and lifestyle posts to users. Gives users the ability to participate in group chats / forums  that discuss a given topic.
- **Market:** Men and Women ages 18 - 35
- **Habit:** This app should be used daily or as often as the user would like depending on how often the usr would like to research and discuss the news.
- **Scope:** First we would like to start by delivering the news and giving users a platform to discuss the news. Eventually we would like to provide our own news media and contents rather than getting information from third party news sources. Also we would like to give users the ability to discuss news topics that may have not been highlighted on our platform.
